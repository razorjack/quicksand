h1. jQuery Quicksand plugin release notes

h2. v1.2

- replacing jQuery .css calls with raw JavaScript .style and removing temporary container improved performance (15%-40% faster) when preparing the animation 
- solved initial animation slowdowns
- added custom attribute functions: instead of providing HTML attribute with unique string, you can specify a function to extract the value: $('#source').quicksand('#dest li', {attribute: function(v) { return $(v).find('img').attr('src')} }); please note that although looks handy, it could be a bit more laggy
- added useScaling option so that you can disable scaling animation for performance reasons (helps a lot on slower machines)
- extended adjustHeight capabilities: from now you can set it to dynamic, auto or false


h2. v1.1

- Fixed issues with position: relative
- Fixed occasional flickering
- Moderate performance improvements
- Disabled any animation in IE6 for more safety
- Added support for jQuery 1.3

h2. v1.0
